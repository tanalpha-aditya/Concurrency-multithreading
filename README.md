# Concurrency-multithreading
It has 2 questions solved upon the concepts of concurrency and has been solved using semaphores and multithreading. 

Few assumptions 
- for con -q2, i am assuming the input to end when a 'end' will be printed. so whevener you want to end the input taking of program just write 'end'
- for concurrency questions i have randomized the printing of outputs if they are occuring at the same second ( same moment )
- I have implemented this to the best of my knowledge and any edgecases which i must have forgotten can be implement by me if explcitly told then are there. As this whole codebase is made from scratch by me I know whereabouts of everything i used and any edgecases can be handled quickly after the issue has been raised.
